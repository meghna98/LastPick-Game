# LastPick-Game
"Pick the Last Ball "is a user-interactive Game built on Python using the Pygame module.
It is a single player versus computer game with simple rules.
Both the player and the game program are allowed to pick either 1 or 2 balls at a time. The player and the computer pick balls in an alternative fashion.
Starting from the first pick by the player followed by alternate picks by the computer and the player thereafter, causes the balls to decrease by certain amount in each turn. 
Hence, the one picking up the last or last 2 balls will be the winner.
